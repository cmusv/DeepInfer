# Badges

We apply for the three badges *Artifacts Evaluated - Reusable*, and *Artifacts Available*. Here are the reasons why we believe that the artifact deserves the badges.


### Reusable
The artifact contains both the data and software components that is executable. We also automated the process of running the tool using command line interface. Specifically, our artifact contains the following to be fully functional.

1. All necessary environment needed to run the tool.
2. We collected benchmark models and datasets from prior works [9, 14, 64, 76] mentioned in the paper.
3. We shared executable Python source codes and a simplified script to execute the tool. We also shared the scripts to execute all models using different datasets.

We also provided detailed instructions for installation, environment setup, and running the tool. Furthermore, we shared the following necessary components of the artifact to make it reusable:

* Instructions to create virtual Python environment and run the tool in that environment.
* We provided general instructions to run the tool on any operating system.
* Automatically install necessary packages from the requirements file.
* Provide shell script file to automate the process of installation and reproduce key results of Table 2 and Table 3.


### Available
The artifact is publicly shared in the GitHub repository: `https://github.com/shibbirtanvin/DeepInfer/`.
